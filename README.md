Hello guys, this 'Rock Paper Scissors' game was created as apart of my interactive UI lesson on The Odin Project. With some help from the TOP discord, I was able to implement some extra interactivities to make my game look and feel a bit more fun to play. Overall, I learned a lot about DOM manipulation and I was able to put my newfound knowledge about loops to good use!
